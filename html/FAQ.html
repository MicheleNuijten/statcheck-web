<h3>What is statcheck?</h3>

<p>Statcheck is basically a spellchecker for statistics. Specifically, it is a program that checks for errors in statistical reporting in APA-formatted documents. It was originally written in the R programming language. statcheck//web is a web-based implementation of statcheck. Using statcheck//web, you can check a document for statistical errors without installing R on your computer.</p>

<p>To use statcheck//web, simply upload a .pdf, .html, or .docx file of your APA-formatted document. The output will identify any errors in statistical reporting that can be identified. (For a summary of what statcheck can and cannot do, see the <a href="https://rpubs.com/michelenuijten/statcheckmanual">statcheck manual</a>).</p>

<h3>What does statcheck look for?</h3>

<p>Statcheck looks for statistical test results. Specifically, it looks for 1) Null Hypothesis Significance Test (NHST) results that are 2) reported in APA style, and 3) complete.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>NHST results</b>: a type of frequentist statistics in which a null hypothesis is tested</li>
  <li> <b>APA reporting style</b>: a specific style of reporting statistics often used in psychology and related fields. See the <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf">APA Style Manual</a> </li>
  <li> <b>Complete statistical result</b>: statcheck needs to know the type of test, the degrees of freedom (if relevant), and the test statistic (a.k.a. the test value) in order to recalculate the p-value. </li>
</ol>
